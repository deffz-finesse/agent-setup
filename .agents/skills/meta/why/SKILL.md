# Why

Investigate the motivation and intent behind code. Why was it built this way? What edge cases were considered? What product, business, or operational constraints shaped the design? What alternatives were rejected, and why?

Companion to the `how` skill. `how` answers what the code does and how it works. `why` answers what forces led to its shape.

## How this skill works

Historical context can live in source control, tickets, long-form documents, chat, observability, error tracking, analytics, or other connected systems. The skill enumerates the active client's available tools at runtime, maps them to evidence categories, queries only sources that actually exist, then synthesizes with explicit confidence calibration. Null results from searched categories are first-class evidence; unavailable categories are reported as gaps. The default is coverage of available evidence, not an assumed application roster.

## Operating Posture

Operate as a careful, cautious, precise investigator. Think like a detective piecing together a historical case from fragmentary records. When the record is thin, say so.

Concretely:

- **Evidence before narrative.** Collect the pieces first, then see what story they support. Never pick a story and recruit the evidence that fits it.
- **Precision over polish.** Prefer the exact quote and citation over a smooth paraphrase. A reader should be able to follow any claim back to its source and verify it in under a minute.
- **Consider what you haven't seen.** The evidence you find is a sample, not the whole truth. Before concluding, ask what you would expect to see if an alternative explanation were true, and whether you looked for it.
- **Name the gaps.** If a thread goes cold, a source isn't searchable, or a question has no answer, document the gap. Don't paper it over with an authoritative-sounding guess.
- **Hedge on purpose.** When evidence is indirect, your language should signal it ("appears to", "likely", "suggests"). Confidence-matching phrasing is a feature of the output, not a stylistic choice the synthesizer may override.
- **No shortcut by code-reading.** The code tells you what it does, rarely why it exists. Resist inferring intent from code shape.

This posture is the working method, not a disclaimer.

## Core Epistemics

This skill builds a **patchwork understanding** from fragmented historical evidence. Tickets go stale. Chat threads get deleted. Commit messages lie. People change their minds between the PR description and the implementation. The original author may have left the company.

Be ruthlessly honest about what you know versus what you're inferring. The goal is not a satisfying story; it is to surface evidence, calibrate confidence, and let the user decide.

Principles:

- **Cite everything.** Every claim about intent should reference a specific commit hash, PR number, ticket ID, doc URL, chat permalink, or code comment. If you can't cite it, it's inference, not fact, and must be labeled as such.
- **Prefer "appears to" over "because".** Hedge when evidence is indirect. Reserve confident language for direct, explicit evidence.
- **Surface contradictions.** If two sources disagree, show both. Don't quietly pick the one that fits your narrative.
- **Acknowledge gaps.** If a question has no answer in any source you searched, say so. An honest "we couldn't find out why" beats a confident guess.
- **Multiple hypotheses are valid.** When the evidence fits several stories, present them all with the evidence for each. Let the user triangulate.
- **Beware rationalization.** Code that makes sense today may have been written for reasons that no longer apply, or for no good reason at all. Don't retrofit intent.

## Step 1. Understand the Target and the Question

Parse what the user is asking. The **target** is usually a chunk of code, a pattern, a feature, or a named design decision. The **question** is usually one of:

- "Why was X designed this way?" Design rationale.
- "Why do we do X instead of Y?" Tradeoff or alternatives.
- "What edge cases motivated this?" Defensive reasoning.
- "What business or product constraint led to this?" External forcing function.
- "Why does this code still exist?" Dead-code territory.
- "What's the history of X?" Broad archaeological sweep.

If the target is vague ("why do we do it this way?" with no clear referent), make your best guess from conversation context (open files, recent edits, cursor location, what was just discussed). State your interpretation briefly so the user can redirect if you're off, then proceed.

## Step 2. Establish the Code Anchor

Before spawning investigators, anchor the investigation in concrete code. You need:

- The relevant file path(s) and line range(s)
- The key symbols (function names, class names, constants)
- An initial commit list. The last few commits touching the target.
- PR numbers from merge commits (pattern `(#1234)` in the subject line)

Build this inline. It's cheap, and every investigator needs it.

```bash
# Blame target lines for last-touch commits
git blame -L <start>,<end> <file>

# Full file history, with patches, through renames
git log --follow -p -- <file>

# Last N commits touching the file, PR numbers visible
git log --oneline -20 -- <file>

# Extract PR numbers from a commit message
git log -1 --format=%B <commit>
```

Pull PR bodies and discussion via `gh` for any substantive commits:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json title,body,author,createdAt,mergedAt,labels,closingIssuesReferences,comments,reviews
```

Capture this as seed context (file paths, symbols, commits, PR numbers, linked ticket IDs). Pass it to the investigators so they don't rediscover it.

## Step 3. Spawn Parallel Investigators (default posture)

**Default to the full parallel investigation.** Each evidence category lives in a different kind of system, and you cannot tell from the question alone which one holds the answer without looking. So look across every available category, in parallel, by default.

### Discovery

Before spawning investigators, inspect the MCPs and tools exposed by the
active client. Use the client's tool list or project configuration when
available. Do not inspect another client's private configuration or assume
that an MCP exists because it is listed in this repository's optional roster.

Map each available MCP to one evidence category:

1. Source control history
2. Issue / ticket tracker
3. Long-form documents
4. Real-time team chat
5. Infrastructure observability
6. Error / exception tracking
7. Product analytics warehouse

Source control is always available through git and `gh`. For other categories, classify using the MCP name, server instructions, tool names, and resource descriptors. If an MCP could fit more than one category, choose the one matching its primary evidence. Record ambiguous cases in the coverage map.

Aim for a complete **coverage map**, not a minimal one. A null result from an available source is evidence the decision was not recorded there, a useful fact in itself. Document the null, don't skip the search.

Launch all matching investigators in a single message so they run concurrently. One investigator per category lets each specialize in one tool's query vocabulary and result shape. Don't ask one agent to cover multiple MCPs.

Subagent config (each):

- Use the active client's native subagent mechanism and configured investigator
  model when available, otherwise inherit the active model. Give investigators
  only the tools needed for their evidence category and prohibit writes or
  external side effects.

Each investigator gets:

1. The base prompt from `references/investigator-prompt.md`
2. A local category playbook when one exists, otherwise the active client's MCP description and tool schema
3. The cross-cutting `references/sources/incident-postmortem.md` **if the target code looks defensive** (null checks, retry logic, timeout handling, rate limiting, feature flags, egress guards, OOM handlers)
4. The code anchor from Step 2 (file paths, symbols, commit hashes, PR numbers, ticket IDs)
5. The user's original question

### Investigator roster

Spawn one investigator per evidence category that has a matching tool or MCP. Each owns exactly one discovered source. Use the category meaning to guide the search, but use the actual MCP name, tool schema, and available playbook in the coverage map.

- **Source control**: always available through git and `gh`.
- **Other categories**: create an investigator only when the active client's tool inventory exposes a matching source. Do not invent a provider-specific integration because it appears in documentation.

### When to skip an investigator

Only skip with an **explicit, written justification** that goes in the final "Sources Consulted" section. Two valid reasons:

- **No MCP is available for that category** in this environment. Flag this as a gap, not a choice. Example: "Real-time team chat skipped. No matching MCP available, so the conversational record was not searchable."
- **The source is provably irrelevant**, not just "probably irrelevant." A high bar. Example: "Error / exception tracking skipped. Target is a build-time script with no runtime code path." Not "probably not in error tracking, it's a feature not an error."

"It's pure feature code, error tracking won't have anything" is **not** sufficient, and neither is "I doubt long-form docs would have this." Run the search; let the null result speak. The cost of an investigator returning empty is one subagent. The cost of missing a design doc that actually exists is a wrong answer.

If your scope assessment suggests a single-commit trivial target where the PR description already contains the complete answer, you may answer inline **only after** confirming all available category searches would be redundant. Say so explicitly. This should be rare.

## Step 4. Synthesize

Spawn one synthesizer subagent using the active client's native mechanism.

- Use the configured synthesizer model when available, otherwise inherit the
  active model. Give it only the evidence sources required for citation checks
  and prohibit writes.

The synthesizer gets:

1. The investigator findings, including any null results and any categories skipped with justification
2. The code anchor from Step 2 (file paths, symbols, commit hashes, PR numbers, ticket IDs)
3. The user's original question
4. The epistemics framework from `references/epistemics.md`
5. The synthesizer prompt template from `references/synthesizer-prompt.md`

Its job is the final output: a confidence-weighted, evidence-cited narrative with clearly separated "what we know" and "what we're inferring" sections, plus honest acknowledgment of gaps and null-result sources.

## Step 5. Present

Take the synthesizer's output and present it to the user. You may lightly edit for clarity or add context from the conversation, but **do not rewrite the confidence language**. The epistemic framing is the product. Dropping the hedges to sound more authoritative is the exact failure mode this skill exists to prevent.

## Output Format

The final output uses this structure. Adapt as needed, but keep the confidence separation intact.

**The Question**. Restate what the user asked, concisely.

**The Code in Question**. File paths, line ranges, and key symbols. One or two lines so the reader is anchored.

**What We Found (direct evidence)**. Claims with explicit citations (PR #, ticket ID, doc URL, chat permalink, commit hash, code comment with file:line). Each bullet is a thing we have textual evidence for. Use present tense and quote or paraphrase the source.

**What We Can Reasonably Infer**. Claims well-supported by indirect evidence or combinations of signals, but not explicitly stated anywhere. Each bullet must explain the inference chain: "Given A and B, it's likely that C." Use hedged language ("appears to", "likely", "suggests").

**Competing Hypotheses**. If the evidence fits multiple stories, list them. For each, give the hypothesis, the evidence for it, and the evidence against it. Don't force a winner when the record doesn't support one. (Skip this section if there's a clear answer.)

**What We Don't Know**. Explicit gaps. Questions the user asked that the evidence didn't answer. Sources we searched and came up empty. Be specific. "We searched the issue tracker for 'rate limit' and found no ticket discussing this specific threshold" is more useful than "we don't know why."

**Sources Consulted**. One line per investigator, including the ones that returned nothing. The reader should see at a glance (a) which MCPs were queried, (b) which came back empty, and (c) which were skipped and why. This coverage map lets the user judge breadth and redirect if something obvious was missed.

Format each line as: `- <Source>: <what was searched>. <what was found, or "no relevant results," or "skipped. reason">.`

Example:

- Source control (git/gh): `git log --follow backend/retry.ts`, PRs #49074, #47812. Found PR #49074 introduced exponential backoff and linked ENG-4421.
- Issue tracker (`<configured MCP>`): searched for "retry" and the linked ticket. Found the parent issue but no discussion of backoff parameters.
- Long-form documentation (`<configured MCP>`): searched for "retry policy," "backend retries," and the linked ticket. No relevant results.
- Real-time team chat (`<configured MCP>`): skipped. No matching MCP was available in this environment. Gap: conversational record not searched.
- Infrastructure observability (`<configured MCP>`): searched retry metrics and monitors around the change date. Found a monitor created in the same window as the change.
- Error / exception tracking (`<configured MCP>`): searched issues first seen around the change date with stack traces through the target. Found an issue spiking before the change.
- Product analytics or warehouse (`<configured MCP>`): queried relevant error or usage events for the window around the change. The event count fell after the change, but no related migration query was found.

After the Sources Consulted block, if the user's `why` question is a precursor to actually changing this code, convert the lineage findings into a Preserve / Change / Avoid / Risk constraint set suitable for planning the change.

## Common Failure Modes to Avoid

- **Confident storytelling**. A plausible narrative built from thin evidence. A bullet with no citation goes in "inferred" or "hypotheses," not "what we found."
- **Citing the code as evidence for its own intent**. "Handles the null case because it checks for null" is mechanics, not motivation. Motivation comes from an external source (PR discussion, ticket, comment, conversation) or is labeled as inference.
- **Recency bias**. Assuming the most recent commit is authoritative. The current shape is often the accretion of many earlier decisions. Trace back.
- **Sycophantic agreement**. If the user suggests a reason ("I assume this is for performance?"), treat it as a hypothesis and check the evidence independently, don't just confirm it.
- **Skipping the gaps section**. An honest accounting of what you couldn't find out is part of the value.
- **Skipping investigators by anticipation**. Deciding up front that an available source probably has nothing useful without searching. The default-to-all-available-sources posture prevents this. A null result is a data point; a skipped search is a blind spot.
- **Collapsing investigators into one agent**. Each MCP has its own query vocabulary, result shape, and pitfalls; pooling them dilutes specialization and makes coverage harder to reason about. Always one investigator per category.
